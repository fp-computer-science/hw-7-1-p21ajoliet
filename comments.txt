Question 2 should only have returned the "o"

Question 4 should have used the in operator.

Question 5 should have had "Peach" and "pear" reversed. The question was not copied correctly.

Question 7 You did not need to declare the number as an int. It would be cast as an int by default.

Question 8 should have used the not in operator.
